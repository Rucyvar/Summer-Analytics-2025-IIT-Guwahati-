## 🧠 Week 1 – Python, NumPy, Pandas & Visualization Basics

### 🎯 Objective

My goal for Week 1 was to build a strong foundation in Python programming and data science libraries such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, while also gaining an initial understanding of **Machine Learning** and **descriptive statistics**.

### 📅 Daily Progress

#### **Day 0 – Environment Setup**
- Set up my environment using **Anaconda** on my system.
- Explored **Kaggle Notebooks** and learned how to add datasets directly to them.

#### **Day 1 – Python Basics & ML Introduction**
- Completed beginner-level Python tutorials, covering syntax, variables, conditionals, and loops.
- Watched introductory content on **Machine Learning** and learned about supervised vs unsupervised learning.

#### **Day 2 – Python Continued & NumPy**
- Continued with Python functions and core data structures.
- Started working with **NumPy** for numerical operations:
  - Practiced array creation, broadcasting, and vectorized operations.
  - Completed a NumPy-focused notebook.

#### **Day 3 – Pandas for Data Analysis**
- Learned how to load, inspect, and manipulate data using **Pandas**:
  - Worked with Series and DataFrames
  - Performed filtering, aggregation, and data transformation
- Completed exercises from the **Kaggle Pandas micro-course**.
- Practiced tasks in a dedicated Pandas notebook.

#### **Day 4 – Matplotlib & ML Applications**
- Used **Matplotlib** to create basic plots (line, bar, histogram).
- Read an article on **common problems solved by machine learning**.
- Attempted an optional visualization task using the latest version of Matplotlib.

#### **Day 5 – Seaborn & Descriptive Statistics**
- Created visualizations using **Seaborn**:
  - Plotted box plots, count plots, and pair plots.
- Studied key concepts in **descriptive statistics**:
  - Central tendencies: mean, median, mode
  - Normal distribution and data spread
